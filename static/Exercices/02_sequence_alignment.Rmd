In this practice session, we go through the process of aligning sequencing data
The goal of this analysis is to align our sequences on our reference genome to 
generate alignment tracks and visualize the transcription signal on the 
reference genome. 

For simplicity purposes, we will be using specialized tools command line in this
practice session, but all data manipulation steps can be performed or modified
pretty easily using a scripting language. The tools that will be needed here
are:

* [cutadapt](https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt)
* [samtools](http://www.htslib.org/)
* [bowtie2](https://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml)
* [deeptools](https://github.com/deeptools/deepTools)
* [IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/)

For the analysis we will use data from *Bacillus subtilis* culture infected by 
its phage SPP1 RNA-seq libraries. The reads are subsampled to accelrate the 
quality check. The reference genome from this library is the YB886 strain from
*Bacillus subtilis* and its phage SPP1.


All the data are available in the `transcriptomics_supbiotech_2023/` folder.

## Trimming the adaptors

As we saw in the first session there were some adapters sequences at the 
beginning of the reads. The solution is to trimmed the reads to remove these 
bases to avoid mapping issues as they were artificially added.

> Looking at the fastqc report from the previous session how much base pairs 
will you remove ?

<details><summary>**Answer:**</summary>
<p>
Looking at the per base sequence report, we can remove 8bp to be sure to remove 
all the adapters sequences.
</p>
</details>
<br>

To trim the sequence we will use [cutadapt](https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt)
software.

reads ?

Once is done you can launch a `fastqc` and `fastq-screen` again to see what have
changed.

You saw that we have removed the biases at the beginning of the reads and select 
the reads with the highest quality. The length is not uniform now as some reads 
have been more trimmed than others. Finally, we have resolved the mapping issue
from the reverse reads.

## Aligning the sequences

Now that we have cleaned and well prepared our sequences we can start our 
analysis. The first step is to align the reads on the reference genome. The most
known algorithm for mapping are `bowtie2`, `bwa` and `minimap`. There are also 
some others aligners more specific to RNA-seq such as `STAR` or `salmon`. For
bacteria where the genomes are small with no repeated regions, there are not 
necessary.

In this practical we will use 
[bowtie2](https://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml) as `bwa` and 
`minimap` are not well suited for very short reads (<100bp).

The aligner algorithm needs to index the fasta. An index will be like a 
dictionnary where the sequence present in the genome are sorted. It will allow 
to find the matching sequences very fast. To build the index using `bowtie2`
you can use `bowtie2-build` command. To simplify the analysis we will just look 
at the genome of the bacteria at T0.

<details><summary>**Clue:**</summary>
<p>
```{sh eval = FALSE}
bowtie2-build --help
```

<details><summary>**Show code:**</summary>
<p>
```{sh eval = FALSE}
mkdir -p reference/index
bowtie2-build reference/YB886.fa reference/index/YB886
```
</p>
</details>
<br>

Once the index is done we can use th e`bowtie2` command to map the reads. We 
will used the `--very-sensitive` method. You can look a the 
[documentation](https://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml):

```{sh eval = FALSE}
bowtie2 --help
```

> What's the seed ?

<details><summary>**Answer:**</summary>
<p>
As trying to map a nicely to all sequence will be slow for the aligner, they 
used a subset of the sequence called seed to find first potential position, then 
they will extend that seed to find the best match. The seed is ste up by the 
`-L` parameter in bowtie2. The bigger the seed is the faster the algorithm is. 
Indeed it will have to extedn on less positions but it may missed the perfect 
position if it didn't take a perfect sequence as the seed.
</p>
</details>
<br>

> What's the `local` alignment mode ? Is it really useful in our case ?

<details><summary>**Answer:**</summary>
<p>
Opposed to `end-to-end` mode the `local` mode is a mode allowing the edges of 
the reads to not be mapped by the aligner. Is it usually advised to use it for
RNA-seq as there are some splicing which will introduce issues with local 
alignment. However, as it's not occuring in bacteria, it is not necessary for us 
to use it. 
</p>
</details>

Launch the alignment using bowtie2 paired end mode:

```{sh eval = FALSE}

### The sam format output

Let's look at the output that we have. The `grep -v '^@'` command allow to show
lines that don't have a `@` at the beginning, *i. e.* the header.

```{sh eval = FALSE}
grep -v '^@' results/alignment/T0.sam | head -n 4
```

```

The file is a `sam` file, which is a tab separated file of 11 columns:

```{r, out.width="100%",  fig.cap="Sam file format", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/sam_format.png")
```

The column that interest us especially is the position of the reads on the 
reference, the flag, information about the mapping and the mapping quality, 
how much a sequence is unique in the reference. 

To see what a flag means, we can use that: 
https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html

> Using it try to explain the different following flags 77, 141, 83, 163, 99, 
147.

The sam file is quite heavy, as for the fastq we are use to work with compressed
files. We will at the same time filter the mapping reads, sort them  and index
them using `samtools`. The `bam` file is the compressed version of `sam`.

```{sh eval = FALSE}
# Sort and compressed the sam file.
samtools sort -n -O BAM results/alignment/T0.sam -o T0_tmp1.bam
# Keep only pairs with both reads mapped.
samtools fixmate --output-fmt bam T0_tmp1.bam T0_tmp2.bam
# Filter reads with low mapping quality.
samtools view --output-fmt bam -f 2 -q 30 -1 -b T0_tmp2.bam -o T0_tmp1.bam
# Sort the resulting reads.
samtools sort --output-fmt bam -l 9 T0_tmp1.bam -o results/alignment/T0_sorted.bam
# Index the reads
samtools index results/alignment/T0_sorted.bam
# Remove the sam files and the temporary files.
rm results/alignment/T0.sam T0_tmp1.bam T0_tmp2.bam
```

The `rm` function allow to remove files through the command lines. Be careful 
with this one, it's permanent deletion.

## Generating the transcription tracks

Once you align the reads you want to compute the coverage on your genome at each 
sequence of interest, genes in our case. To do that we will use the 
`bamCoverage` function from [deeptools](https://github.com/deeptools/deepTools).

```{sh eval = FALSE}
mkdir -p results/tracks
bamCoverage --bam results/alignment/T0_sorted.bam \
    --outFileName results/tracks/T0_unstranded.bw \
    --binSize 1 \
    --normalizeUsing CPM \
    --extendReads \
    --ignoreDuplicates
bamCoverage --bam results/alignment/T0_sorted.bam \
    --outFileName results/tracks/T0_forward.bw \
    --binSize 1 \
    --normalizeUsing CPM \
    --extendReads \
    --filterRNAstrand forward \
    --ignoreDuplicates
bamCoverage --bam results/alignment/T0_sorted.bam \
    --outFileName results/tracks/T0_reverse.bw \
    --binSize 1 \
    --normalizeUsing CPM \
    --extendReads \
    --filterRNAstrand reverse \
    --ignoreDuplicates
```

The output files are `bigwig` which are compress files with coverage of a 
genomic track. 

> What's the `extendReads` option ?

<details><summary>**Answer:**</summary>
<p>
As we have a pair file, the `extendreads` option will just use also the sequence
between the forward and reverse to compute the coverage.
</p>
</details>
<br>

> What does CPM means ? Why are we using that normalization ?

<details><summary>**Answer:**</summary>
<p>
CPM means Count Per Millions. The idea of that normalization is to get rid of 
the difference between the numbers of mapping reads in a library (Sequencing 
twice more will yield twice more coverage otherwise).
</p>
</details>
<br>

> What is the point to filter the reads based on their strand in a RNA-seq and 
to generate two tracks ?

<details><summary>**Answer:**</summary>
<p>
We did a stranded library, so we can generate a forward and reverse tracks which
are both biologically relevant. Filtering the strand allows to generate the two 
tracks separately.
</p>
</details>
<br>

## Visualizing the alignment using IGV

Now let's visualize our tracks using IGV. In IGV you can load the fasta genome
and then the sorted `bam`, `bigwig` or `gff`. The `gff` is the genome annotation 
file with the genes position.
